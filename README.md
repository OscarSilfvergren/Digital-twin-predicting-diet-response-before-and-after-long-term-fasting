Mathematical model that predicts diets consiting of protein, carbohydrates and fasting interventions through 
integrating partial insight from several clinical studies (estimation data) into an interconnective and big 
picture (predictions).

All scripts, functions, models, and data used are attached in this map. Please run scripts initially through 
the script called "main" to ensure that all data and variables are loaded properly. 
Scritps have been created to make it easy to plot all figures used in article, see "Figure2.m", "Figure3.m" etc.
To be able to create a mex file you need to run IQM toolbox prior of the main. Please see attached map "IQMtools" and read 
the instructions listed.

If needed, please contact gunnar.cedersund@liu.se for any questions.

Best regards,
Oscar Silfvergren
